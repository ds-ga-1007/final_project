class ConnectionActivationLayer(Layer):
    '''
    ConnectionActivation Layers are used to represent a Layer that consists
    of a FullyConnectedLayer and then an ActivationLayer.
    Each ConnectionActivationLayer is just an abstraction of these two layers
    because, from a feed forward neural networks point of view,
    the connection between any two layers is often a fully connected layer
    that outputs a transfer function of the matrix multiplication of the
    previous layer and it's edge weights.
    Also, for other types of neural networks such as convolutional neural
    networks, the network may have other layer types but ConnectionActivationLayers
    are a core, commonly used layer type.
