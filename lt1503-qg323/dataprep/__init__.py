nn-uf data preparation module

The data preparation is separated into mainly two parts:
    1. `Loader`
        Extracts a pandas DataFrame from a given data source.
    2. `Transformer`
        Converts the pandas DataFrame to either pandas.DataFrame instances
        or numpy.ndarray instances for training and testing.
        Data preprocessing falls into this category.
