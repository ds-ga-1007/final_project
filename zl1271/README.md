# Predicting Income

Final project by Zimu Li (zl1271)

## User Guide

This program explores the relationship between income, age, education, sex, and race.

The full model predicts income based on age, education, sex, and their interactions. No plots of the full model will be saved since it has too many predictors.

Additionally, you can view descriptive statistics, or run a regression model.
