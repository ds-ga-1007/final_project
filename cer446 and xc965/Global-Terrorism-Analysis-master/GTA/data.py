'''
This module:
    - converts the excel dataset file into the csv file
    - processes the dataset with selected features
    - get new dataframe
    - store the new dataframe in csv file
    - load country geo json file into dict

The whole process simply aims at generating the original dataset
and shortening the loading time for future data manipulations.

    Notice! We used this function to convert the original dataset into csv file
    Due to the massive dataset volumn with long converting time,
    we have uploaded the a ready-to-use 'gtd_wholedata.csv' file online.

    Instructions for how to download this dataset is in the User Manual.
    Please make sure that you have the required dataset downloaded to your local repository.
