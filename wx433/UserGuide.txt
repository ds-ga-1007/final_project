Description
Our program is used to analyze the data of motor vehicle collisions from NYPD. The data set contains 29 features including data, time, borough, etc.
Our program has 3 part: Overview, Sorting and Casualty Analysis. Use it by clicking on what you want!
The heatmap function is based on tweets heatmap by Kelsey Jordahl, Enthought in Scipy 2013 geospatial tutorial. See more in github page: https://github.com/kjordahl/SciPy2013.


Install
Please download the final_project repository. In the repository you will find these python files:

And 1 data document we need to analyze:

The data document may be too large to upload into github. If you can not find it in this repository, you can also download it in https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions/h9gi-nx95. Please download the csv document.
