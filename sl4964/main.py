'''This is the main program. It gives the user two options: choose a song provided in the package, or provide a midi audio 
fileof their choice. Whatever file the user chooses, the program outputs a classification result, tellling the user if the
musical style of the audio file is closer to Jazz or Classical music. the program also visualizes the velocity and musical
notes of the audio file by different channels with both 2d and 3d plots.'''
#Wenjie: namemap is a df with 3 columns: MidiName, Label, and Prediction, which is 1 for Jazz and 0 for Classical. 
#When user puts in a number i, use the number as the index to get the MidiName:
# songname = namemap.loc[i]['MidiName'].  Get the song i's messages from df_toplot: df_toplot[df_toplot['MidiName' == songname]] for plotting.

Jazz or Classical music. \nYou have the option of either providing your own midi file, or picking one from the built-in package.\
